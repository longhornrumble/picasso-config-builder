## Risk Assessment

### Risks Identified ✅ All Mitigated
1. **Complexity Risk** - Form Editor too complex
   - ✅ Mitigated: Broke into smaller components (FieldsManager, FieldEditor)

2. **Pattern Consistency Risk** - Editors diverge in structure
   - ✅ Mitigated: Programs Editor established pattern first, all follow

3. **Dependency Management Risk** - Cascading deletions
   - ✅ Mitigated: Dependency checking prevents deletion, shows dependencies

4. **Validation Risk** - Complex validation logic
   - ✅ Mitigated: Zod schemas handle complexity, real-time feedback

5. **Build Performance Risk** - Bundle size too large
   - ✅ Mitigated: Code splitting, tree shaking, acceptable bundle size

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **Pattern-first approach** - Establishing pattern with simplest editor (Programs) paid off
2. **Incremental complexity** - Programs → Branches → CTAs → Forms natural progression
3. **SOP validation** - Mandatory validation caught issues early
4. **Zustand store** - Well-designed slices made integration smooth
5. **TypeScript** - Caught type errors before runtime
6. **Reusable components** - Textarea, array inputs used across editors

### Areas for Improvement
1. **Drag-and-drop** - Up/down arrows work but drag-and-drop would be better UX
2. **Bulk operations** - Would improve efficiency for large configs
3. **Search/filter** - Needed when entity counts grow
4. **Performance** - Consider virtualization for large lists
5. **Testing** - Unit tests would increase confidence

   - Deploy to tenant buckets
   - Version management

2. **Advanced Form Features** (Priority: Medium)
   - Post-submission actions
   - Fulfillment methods (email, webhook, DynamoDB, Sheets)
   - Next steps array

3. **Bulk Operations** (Priority: Medium)
   - Import configurations (JSON)
   - Export configurations
   - Duplicate entities
   - Batch delete with dependency resolution

4. **Search & Filter** (Priority: Medium)
   - Search by name/ID
   - Filter by enabled/disabled
   - Filter by dependencies

5. **Testing & QA** (Priority: High)
   - Unit tests for all editors
   - Integration tests
   - E2E tests
   - Accessibility audit

6. **Performance Optimization** (Priority: Low)
   - Virtualized lists for 100+ items

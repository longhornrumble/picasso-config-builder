3. Try duplicate IDs ‚Üí Errors
4. Fix all issues ‚Üí Success

### Scenario 3: Dependency Path
1. Create CTA
2. Assign to branch
3. Try to delete CTA ‚Üí Blocked
4. Remove from branch
5. Delete CTA ‚Üí Success

### Scenario 4: Edge Cases
1. Create with very long names/descriptions
2. Create with special characters

# Go to Console tab
# Look for red errors
```

### Common Issues

**Modal doesn't open:**
- Check console for errors
- Verify React rendering

**Form doesn't save:**
